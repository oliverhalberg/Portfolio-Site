# Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for oliverhalberg.com. 

Elements of code and styling are based off materials provided by Treehouse as part of courses and workshops.

### Known issues
- While it is technically mobile-friendly, the site still has larger margins on the sides than I would like when viewed on smaller screens.
