            <h3>Computer Science Department Coach, Vassar College</h3>
            <p>September 2022 - May 2024</p>
            <p>
                During my third and fourth years at Vassar College, I was hired by the Computer Science Department to work as a student coach 
                for three different intermediate-level computer science courses (Computer Science II: Data Structures and Algorithms, 
                Computer Science III: Software Design and Implementation, and Computer Organization) over four semesters. As a coach, I assisted
                professors during labs and held office hours where students could come for help on course materials and assignments. I gained 
                valuable experience debugging code, providing constructive feedback, and communicating computer science concepts in an understandable
                fashion.
