            "description": "In tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons, it is often useful to have a tool to keep track of the order of combat turns, also known as \"initiative\".

To keep things manageable, I designed a minimal text-based user interface that allows users to add and remove turns, display them in order, and step through turns individually.",
